Roxarm is an affordable prosthetic arm that can be built with off-the-shelf parts. It uses tendon system with fishing wires to ensure having power on both opening and closing of the hand. Pressure sensor are placed on the fingertips helps to provide feedback to the user with vibration motors at the arm's base. It has special circuitry that cand etect the each motor's current use and depending on that adjusts the pressure being put on fingers. <br />

Most of the parts have been 3d printed, can be found on step file. <br />
The electro-mechanical parts list: <br />
5 x Mg995 180 degrees servo motors<br />
1 x uMyo wireless EMG sensor<br />
1 x ESP32<br />
5 x pressure sensors <br />
5 x vibration motors <br />

Resistors and wirirng can be found on circuit diagram down below.
